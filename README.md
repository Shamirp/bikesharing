## Summary 

•	Getting the user on board with the bike-sharing program involves creating a welcoming environment. Telling and showing users that they are not alone and that there are many other people biking just like them will boost users’ confidence and create a group setting rather than an individual journey or achievement.  

•	Utilizing the knowledge of the highest biking activity by hour tells a lot about the biking community. Most users of this program will benefit from knowing that biking is best done to start your day or to end your workday. This creates a set time and increases the chance of biking becoming a habit. 

•	The user will benefit from knowing that there is no “certain duration of time” you should be biking. The bike-sharing data shows users will bike for any amount of time from 5 minutes to 60+ minutes. This will encourage users of all biking levels to get out there no matter their skill level.
